        <ol>
            <li>Click the <strong>menu button</strong> at the top left and add a new document.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Copy</strong> the permanent, unique link to your notebook at the top right.
                <ul>
                    <li>Save this link!  It's how you'll access your notebook later.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Share</strong> the link with someone and start collaborating!</li>
